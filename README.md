## Introduction
The University of British Columbia (UBC) Vancouver campus spans over **400 acres**, making efficient navigation a challenge. Students frequently travel between buildings, requiring optimal routing strategies to **minimize travel time**.  

Our group applies **linear programming** to solve **pathfinding problems** at UBC. We implement a **graph-based model** where buildings are represented as **nodes**, and roads are **edges** weighted by distance.  

Additionally, we address sub-problems such as **finding the best dining hall** that minimizes the travel distance between two classes.

---

## Problems

### Shortest Path Between Two Classes
A **flow network** is a directed graph consisting of nodes and edges, each with a **capacity and flow**. While network flow problems are often solved using combinatorial methods, they can also be formulated as **linear programming (LP) problems**.  

#### **Variables:**
- **N**: Set of all buildings, road intersections, and endpoints (nodes)
- **E**: Set of all edges between nodes
- **b_k**: Flow generated by node \( k \)
  - \( b_o = 1 \) (origin node)
  - \( b_d = -1 \) (destination node)
  - \( b_k = 0 \) (otherwise)
- **d_{ij}**: Distance between nodes \( i \) and \( j \) (edge weight)
- **x_{ij}**: Flow variable
  - \( 1 \) if edge \( (i,j) \) is part of the shortest path
  - \( 0 \) otherwise
- **u_{ij} = 1**: Capacity constraint

#### **Linear Programming Formulation:**

**Minimize:**
$$
\sum_{i \in N} \sum_{j \in N} d_{ij} x_{ij}
$$

**Subject to:**
$$
\sum_{i \in N} x_{oi} - \sum_{j \in N} x_{jo} = b_0, \quad \forall i,j \in N
$$
$$
\sum_{i \in N} x_{di} - \sum_{j \in N} x_{jd} = b_d, \quad \forall i,j \in N
$$
$$
\sum_{i \in N} x_{ki} - \sum_{j \in N} x_{jk} = b_k, \quad \forall i,j,k \in N
$$
$$
0 \leq x_{ij} \leq u_{ij}, \quad d_{ij} > 0, \quad x_{ij} \in \{0,1\}
$$

The objective function minimizes total distance, and constraints ensure **flow conservation across nodes**.

### Best Dining Option Between Two Classes
This problem can be solved using two methods:
1. **Shortest Path Method**
2. **Utility Score Method**

#### **Additional Variables:**
- **R**: Set of all dining halls
- **r_i**: Binary variable for dining hall selection

For **utility-based selection**, we introduce:
- **u_r**: Utility score for restaurant \( r \)
- **y_r**: Binary variable:
  - \( 1 \) if restaurant \( r \) is chosen
  - \( 0 \) otherwise

The objective function optimizes:
$$
\min \sum_{i,j \in E} d_{ij} x_{ij} - \sum_{r \in R} u_r y_r
$$

---

### Median Shortest Path
The **Median Shortest Path Problem (MSPP)** determines an optimal meeting point minimizing the total travel distance for multiple individuals.  

#### **Variables:**
- **x^s_{ij}**: Binary variable for student \( s \) traveling along edge \( (i,j) \)
- **m_k**: Binary variable indicating if node \( k \) is the meeting point

**Objective Function:**
$$
\min \sum_{s \in S} \sum_{(i,j)\in E} d_{ij} x^s_{ij}
$$

**Subject to:**
$$
\sum_{j \in N} x^s_{ij} - \sum_{j \in N} x^s_{ji} =
\begin{cases}
1, & i=s\\
-1, & i=m\\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\sum_{k \in N} m_k = 1
$$

$$
x^s_{ij} \in \{0,1\}, \quad m_k \in \{0,1\}
$$

This ensures each student follows an optimal route to the **common meeting point**.

## Methodology
All code can be found in our **[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MisShenanigans/UBC-Pathfinder)**.  

We used geospatial data from the **[UBC Geospatial Open Data](https://github.com/UBCGeodata/ubc-geospatial-opendata)** to construct a **graph model of UBC**, ensuring a **connected network** for continuous paths.

---

## Results

### Shortest Path Between Classes
Example: **Crescent West (CRSW) to Leonard S. Klinck (LSK)**
- **Computed Distance**: **2594.02 meters**
- **Google Maps Distance**: **2700 meters**

### Best Dining Option
Example: **Student Recreation Centre (SRC) to LSK**
- **Optimal Dining Hall**: **Orchard Commons**
- **Computed Distance**: **620.83 meters**

### Median Shortest Path
Using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**, we determined an **optimal meeting point** that minimizes total travel costs.

---

## Discussion

### Shortest Path Problem
- Our computed shortest paths were often **shorter** than Google Maps’ suggestions.
- However, **real-time factors** (construction, road conditions) are not accounted for.

### Best Dining Option
- The **shortest path method** does not consider previously traveled paths.
- The **utility-based method** provides a **more flexible** solution.

### Median Shortest Path
- Our **heuristic approach** (Dijkstra’s Algorithm) returned **reasonable results**.
- The **LP formulation** faced **infeasibility issues**, requiring further refinement.

---

## Conclusion
This project successfully applied **linear programming** to **pathfinding problems** at UBC. We implemented models for:
1. **Shortest paths** between classes
2. **Optimal dining hall selection**
3. **Median shortest path meeting point**

Future improvements could include:
- **Incorporating real-time data** (traffic, walking conditions)
- **Improving computational efficiency** in large-scale networks
